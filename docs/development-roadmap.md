## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Electron Learning Curve**: Allocate extra time for learning
- **Data Complexity**: Start with simplified data models
- **Performance Issues**: Implement performance monitoring early
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Test on multiple platforms regularly

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to MVP features initially
- **Technical Debt**: Refactor code regularly
- **Testing Delays**: Start testing early in each phase
- **Documentation Lag**: Document as you develop
