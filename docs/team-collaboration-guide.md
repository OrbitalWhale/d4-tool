# Team Collaboration Guide - Diablo 4 Build Tool

This guide outlines how to work effectively as a team on the Diablo 4 Build Tool project.

## üë• Team Structure

### Roles and Responsibilities
- **Project Lead**: Overall project direction and coordination
- **Developers**: Feature implementation and bug fixes
- **Reviewers**: Code review and quality assurance
- **Testers**: Testing and feedback

### Communication Channels
- **GitHub Issues**: Task tracking and bug reports
- **GitHub Discussions**: Team discussions and planning
- **Pull Requests**: Code review and collaboration
- **Project Board**: Visual task management (recommended)

## ü§ù Team Workflow

### 1. Planning and Task Assignment
- Use GitHub Issues for all tasks
- Assign issues to team members
- Use labels for priority and type
- Set milestones for releases

### 2. Development Process
```bash
# Always start from main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Work on your feature
# ... make changes ...

# Commit with clear messages
git commit -m "feat(ui): add character class selector"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Code Review Process
- **Self-Review**: Review your own code before requesting review
- **Peer Review**: At least one team member must approve
- **Address Feedback**: Respond to all review comments
- **Merge Only After Approval**: Never merge your own PRs

## üìã Team-Specific Guidelines

### Branch Naming Convention
```
feature/feature-name          # New features
fix/bug-description          # Bug fixes
refactor/component-name      # Code refactoring
docs/documentation-update    # Documentation changes
```

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Examples:
- `feat(ui): add character class selector component`
- `fix(parser): resolve JSON validation error`
- `refactor(core): simplify build validation logic`

### Issue Labels for Team Use
- **Priority**: `high`, `medium`, `low`
- **Type**: `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `testing`
- **Status**: `in-progress`, `review-needed`, `blocked`
- **Team**: `frontend`, `backend`, `ui/ux`, `testing`

## üîÑ Daily Team Workflow

### Morning Standup (Optional)
- Review yesterday's progress
- Plan today's tasks
- Identify blockers
- Update issue statuses

### During Development
- Update issue status as you work
- Comment on issues with progress updates
- Tag team members when you need input
- Use draft PRs for early feedback

### End of Day
- Commit and push your work
- Update issue status to "in-progress" or "review-needed"
- Create PRs for completed features
- Update project board if using one

## üö® Conflict Resolution

### Code Conflicts
- Always pull latest changes before starting work
- Resolve conflicts locally before pushing
- Ask for help if conflicts are complex
- Use `git rebase` to keep history clean

### Technical Disagreements
- Discuss in GitHub Discussions
- Create RFC (Request for Comments) issues for major decisions
- Use voting or consensus building
- Document decisions in project documentation

### Communication Issues
- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Use private channels for sensitive discussions
- Escalate to project lead if needed
