# Diablo 4 Build Tool - Project Plan

## Project Overview
A desktop application built with Electron to help Diablo 4 players create, manage, and share character builds. The tool will parse JSON data containing game information and provide an intuitive UI for build creation and management.

## Learning Objectives
- Learn Electron framework for desktop application development
- Understand desktop app architecture and development workflow
- Practice JSON parsing and data manipulation
- Build responsive desktop UI components
- Implement data persistence and export functionality

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Desktop Framework**: Electron
- **Build Tool**: npm/yarn
- **Data Format**: JSON
- **UI Framework**: (To be decided - vanilla JS, React, Vue, etc.)

```

## Core Features (MVP)
1. **JSON Data Parser**
   - Load and parse Diablo 4 game data from JSON files
   - Validate data structure and handle errors gracefully
   - Cache parsed data for performance

2. **Build Creator**
   - Character class selection
   - Skill tree visualization and selection
   - Equipment and item management
   - Stat calculation and display

3. **Build Manager**
   - Save/load builds locally
   - Build templates and presets
   - Build comparison tools
   - Export builds in various formats

4. **User Interface**
   - Modern, responsive design
   - Intuitive navigation
   - Search and filtering capabilities
   - Dark/light theme support

## Data Structure Planning
We need to understand the JSON data structure to plan our parser:
- What fields are available?
- How are skills, items, and stats organized?
- Are there relationships between different data types?
- What validation rules exist?

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Learning
- [ ] Initialize Electron project
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Learn Electron basics (main vs renderer processes)
- [ ] Create basic project structure
- [ ] Set up build and development scripts

### Phase 2: Data Layer
- [ ] Analyze JSON data structure
- [ ] Design data models and interfaces
- [ ] Implement JSON parser
- [ ] Add data validation
- [ ] Create data caching system

### Phase 3: Core UI Components
- [ ] Design application layout
- [ ] Implement navigation system
- [ ] Create character class selector
- [ ] Build skill tree component
- [ ] Add equipment management UI

### Phase 4: Build Management
- [ ] Implement build saving/loading
- [ ] Add build templates
- [ ] Create build comparison tools
- [ ] Implement export functionality

### Phase 5: Polish & Testing
- [ ] Add error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Add accessibility features
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] User testing and feedback

## Technical Considerations

### Electron Architecture
- **Main Process**: Handles app lifecycle, file system access, and native APIs
- **Renderer Process**: Manages UI and user interactions
- **IPC Communication**: Secure communication between processes

### Data Management
- Local storage for user builds
- Efficient JSON parsing and caching
- Data validation and error handling
- Memory management for large datasets

### Performance
- Lazy loading of UI components
- Efficient data rendering for large skill trees
- Background processing for heavy calculations
- Responsive UI during data operations

## Questions to Resolve
1. What does the JSON data structure look like?
2. Should we use a UI framework (React, Vue) or vanilla JS?
3. What build targets do we need (Windows, macOS, Linux)?
4. How should we handle data updates when game patches occur?
5. What export formats are most useful for users?

## Next Steps
1. Examine the JSON data file to understand structure
2. Set up basic Electron project
3. Create data models and parser architecture
4. Design initial UI mockups
5. Begin implementation of core features
